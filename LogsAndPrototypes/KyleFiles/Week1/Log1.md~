Task: Create a prototype of the login page for the room reservation system. 

Time estimate: 45 Minutes 

Actual time: 1 Hour 16 Minutes 

Notes: Using moqups.com, I set out to create a prototype of what a<br /> login page COULD look like for the room reservation system. I did not<br /> spend much time coming up with the color scheme. The layout<br /> of the page is a basic webpage layout. The page includes:<br /> a logo with a title of the system, a fixed directory at<br /> the top of the page, a username and password text box, a<br /> submission button, a footer with fake copyright information, and a<br /> message for the user to read before logging in. This page would be<br /> the second page presented to the user. The very first page<br /> that the user comes to is a page that asks them to select a<br /> university before entering the site. After that has been done, they are<br /> presented with the login page. Really, we could have the<br /> choose your university and the login input screen all on one page.<br /> Awaiting results of the meeting with the client. This is<br /> being done in hopes of assisting are client in invisioning the<br /> product they would like us to create.
