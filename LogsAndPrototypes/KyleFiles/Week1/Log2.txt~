Task: Construct a user input prototype page for choosing a building, room, and time to reserve for the room reservation system. 

Time estimate: 30 Minutes

Actual time: 10 Minutes

Notes: I used the same layout from the login prototype page. It did not take very long to add three drop down menus with labels and a new submission button. There is also a note for the user on this page. Again, this prototype was built for the requirements phase with hopes to assist our client in envisioning what they want their product to look like (and function like).
