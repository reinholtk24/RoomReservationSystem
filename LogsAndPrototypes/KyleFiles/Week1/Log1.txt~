Task: Create a prototype of the login page for the room reservation system. 

Time estimate: 45 Minutes 

Actual time: 1 Hour 16 Minutes 

Notes: Using moqups.com, I set out to create a prototype of what a login page COULD look like for the room reservation system. I did not spend much time coming up with the color scheme. The layout of the page is a basic webpage layout. The page includes: a logo with a title of the system, a fixed directory at the top of the page, a username and password text box, a submission button, a footer with fake copyright information, and a message for the user to read before logging in. This page would be the second page presented to the user. The very first page that the user comes to is a page that asks them to select a university before entering the site. After that has been done, they are presented with the login page. Really, we could have the choose your university and the login input screen all on one page. Awaiting results of the meeting with the client. This is being done in hopes of assisting are client in invisioning the product they would like us to create.
