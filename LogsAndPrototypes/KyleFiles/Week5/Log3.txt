Task: Learning about MySQL 

Time estimate: 1.5 hours 

Actual time: 2 hours

Notes: I have the book, Learning PHP, MySQL, and Javascript by O'Reilly. I am reading about MySQL while working through the examples in the book about how to create a local database, add tables to it, and determine which data types to use in a given situation.
